\section{Motivation} % {{{

For many decades Sixel and ReGIS have been the only image protocols for terminal emulators.
While both are ancient and not even widely implemented, newer generations of people are used
to seeing images and even emoji everywhere.
Those people may eventually touch a virtual terminal emulator and expect to be it no different
than what they are used to from other software systems.
\todo{What about Tektronix?}

There is a growing interest in displaying images in todays
virtual terminal emulators.

Since these protocols are were not designed with todays needs in mind,
virtual terminal emulaor developers have started implementing their own
proprietary protocols for displaying images as Sixel and related
were simply not state of the art anymore.

While this is positive, it also leads to fragmentation in the ecosystem
because application developers do not know what to support in case they intend
to display images in their client applications.

There is also recently a late resurrection of the Sixel bitmap protocol
to be implemented by some terminal emulators and library developers,
however, none of them is 100\% conforming to how Sixel used to work 40 years ago,
as there is no easy way to access the hardware they were implemented on
and also xterm does not implement every aspect of Sixel.

This specification attempts to unify all those image protocols and addresses
some of the issues, not as a superset, but rather as a largest common denominator,
with implementation adaptability in mind.

\section{Terminology} % {{{
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{screen cell}; a rectanglular area of the screen that can contain a character with
        its graphics rendition or an image fragment
    \item \textbf{image fragment}; a rectanglular tile of an image that perfectly fits into a screen cell
    \item \textbf{image storage pool}; a backing store for images received for future operations
\end{itemize}
\todo{more terminology to add?}
% }}}
\section{Prior art and current state} % {{{

Prior art of image protocols for terminals are as follows:

\subsection{Tektronix}

\begin{itemize}
    \item First appeared in 1970s
    \item Tektronix 4010 series was a family of text-and-graphics computer terminals based on storage-tube technology created by Tektronix.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{DEC ReGIS graphics}

\begin{itemize}
    \item First appeared in VT125, in July 1981
    \item vector graphics based
    \item implemented by: xterm
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sixel graphics}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Sixel grpahics first appeared in LA50 dot-matrix printers (1983) and short after in the VT240 in Oktober 1983.
    \item It is pixel based and positions the graphics cursor in a way it is most optimal for dot printers,
        that could print 6 pixels in height per line.
    \item Specialized image format optimized for 6-pin printers.
    \item Supports scrolling the screen if the image does not fit the current screen.
    \item implemented by: xterm, mlterm, wezterm, contour, VTE
\end{itemize}

\subsection{iTerm2 image protocol}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Can associate a file name (Base64 encoded) to the rendered image.
    \item Image display size can be pixel based as well as cell based.
    \item Also has the ability to address the width and height relative to the terminal window size.
    \item Image data is Base64 encoded.
\end{itemize}

\todo{When was iTerm2 image protocol first introduced?}
\todo{iTerm2 supported image formats?}

\subsection{Terminology image protocol}

Terminology's image protocol is rather a media transport protocol as it
can also be used to render animations, including videos.

\begin{itemize}
    \item First appeared in June, 2012.
    \item Uses VT sequences inspired by Xterm's sequence extensions.
    \item Specification is in the source code repository's \texttt{README.md} file.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Kitty image protocol}

\begin{itemize}
    \item First appeared in 2017
    \item Seperates image upload from image display
    \item Can mandate image sizes in pixels as well as in screen cell dimensions.
    \item Images are rendered independantly of text with a specified Z-axis.
    \item Images can be deleted without knowning their names but only by specifying X/Y/Z axis
          and delete all images intersecting these criteria.
    \item Image formats supported are: RGB, RGBA, PNG.
    \item Image data is Base64 encoded.
    \item Supports optionally compressing the image data.
    \item Supports various image data transmission methods:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item inline, as part of the VT sequence
            \item named shared memory
            \item path to local files
        \end{itemize}
    \item Optionally deletes the local file when requested and the file path is in a secure location.
    \item Hard coded image storage pool to 320 MB (per screen buffer).
\end{itemize}

None of the above image protocols are a good candiate. iTerm2's image protocol is very simple and
can be rendered by specifying screen cell sizes instead of relying on pixels, but lacks some
flexibility.

Kitty image protocol on the other hand does provide very good flexibility but is way too complex which
would hinder broader adoptability and conforming implementations. There is also an added complexity
(such as support for Z-axis) and the ability to send images in a way that does not work trivially
when the terminal is connected to remote clients (such as via SSH). This all seems to hinder
adopting a otherwise very flexible image protocol.

The \GoodImageProtocol specification aims to be future proof with regards to the young generation
of terminal users, as well as simple enough to be widely accepted and adopted on the terminal side
as well as client side, yet allowing future extensions to this protocol
without breaking compatibility to existing implementations.

\subsection{DomTerm's inline image support}

\begin{itemize}
    \item DomTerm's image support appeared in 2016.
    \item No explicit image protocol but a "insert HTML"-protocol that does support images.
    \item Specification is in the source code repository's \texttt{README.md} file.
\end{itemize}

The typical way to insert an image is to insert an HTML <img> element,
with the src attribute using a data: URL scheme,
with the actual data inline as base64.

Any image format supported by the underlying browser engine is allowed.

The \texttt{<img>} element can contain attributes such as width, height, alt
and options to add scrollbars.
% }}}
\section{Requirements} % {{{

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Deterministic emulation} - The image rendering must not be affected by font size
        or similar properties nor on external API to make productive use of this protocol.
    \item \textbf{Synchronous operations by default} - No asynchronous operations unless explicitly requested.
    \item \textbf{Remote-terminal capable} - No dependency on the local host, such as the local file system.
    \item \textbf{Preserve aspect ratio by default}
    \item \textbf{Upload and Render seperation} - Image upload must be decoupled from image display
    \item \textbf{Support for rendering tiles of an image} - Adding the ability to only render tiles
        of an image greatly assists client applications when only rendering parts of an image is
        needed (such as in multiplexers).
    \item \textbf{Protocol forward-compatibility} - the protocol must be easily extendable in input
        parameters as well as reusability of the image storage pool
        (such as icon-display, desktop-notifications, background images)
    \item \textbf{Feature detectability} - The image protocl must be easily detectable by well known techniques.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph*{}

The document at [\ref{ref:twg-gip}] suggests cell based masking for rendering to help rendering more
complex scenes such as in windowed TUI applications or terminal multiplexers with overlaying contents.
However, the same can be achieved with a sequence of Image-Render commands specifying a
sub-rectangle to be rendered of the referenced image.

% }}}
\section{Backwards Compatibility} % {{{

Since all other image protocols are pixel based, the proposed image protocol does not
attempt to retain any backwards compatibility. Instead, the goal is to create
an image protocol that is future proof with todays needs in mind.

% }}}
\section{Future Compatibility and Stability} % {{{

In order to leave room for improvements, the VT sequences should be designed in a way
that allows specifying additional parameters in the future, and simultaneously ensures
that older implementations can still work while safely ignoring any new parameters.

% }}}
\section{Terminal Emulator Requirements} % {{{

This is the list of resource requirements that must be guaranteed
by the virtual terminal emulator.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item at least 32 images displayable concurrently
          (given enough grid cells are available)
    \item at least 4 MB per image uncompressed (RGBA8888)
    \item at least 128 MB per storage pool (\(4 * 32\))
\end{enumerate}

Upper limits must be present for security reasons but can be varying by implementation.

\todo{What should happen when the number of images an application wants
      to display is higher than the limit?}

% }}}
\section{Performance Considerations} % {{{

TBD.

% }}}
\section{Security Considerations} % {{{

\todo{Here be dragons.}
\begin{itemize}
    \item image upload spamming
    \item huge image Uploads
    \item invalid image Uploads
    \item invalid image render requests (such as out of bounds in offsetted-renders)
\end{itemize}

% }}}
\section{Semantics} % {{{

\subsection{Upload Image}

Uploads an image for future render operations.

\subsubsection*{Parameters}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
  \hline
  \textbf{parameter name} & \textbf{default} & \textbf{description} \\
  \hline
  \textbf{name}           &                  & a unique identifier for the uploaded image \\
  \textbf{format}         & RGBA             & a value that determines the image format. \\
                          &                  & See section \ref{sec:supported-image-formtats} for available image formats \\
  \textbf{width}          &                  & optional pixel width of the given image (only required for RGB/RGBA format) \\
  \textbf{height}         &                  & optional pixel height of the given image (only required for RGB/RGBA format) \\
  \textbf{data}           &                  & image data in the given input format \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}

\subsubsection{Idempotency}

Image upload can be implemented to be idempotent, i.e. the storage pool keeps an internal hash
of each image that is automatically constructed upon image upload.
If the image was already uploaded, that image's reference count is incremented
and in case it is a named resource, that one will point to that existing one.

\subsubsection{Storage Management}

Uploaded images are reference counted. Uploading a named image will initialize its reference count to 1.

When uploading an image would exceed the storage pool's guarantees,
the host may choose to actively evict images in FIFO-order until the new image fits.

If the image is larger than the allowed storage size, the upload will fail.

Evicted images that were still held in screen cells may display a
unicode object replacement codepoint (U+FFFC) or an empty cell.
\todo{Can this even happen? Due to ref-counting it should not.}

Displaying an image results in incrementing the reference counter
by the number of screen cells that are holding fragments of the image.

Clearing a screen cell holding an image fragment (e.g. by overwriting
or deleting its contents) will decrement the image reference counter.

When no screen cell is holding a reference to the image,
the corresponding reference counter should be either 1 (if uploaded in a separate step)
or 0 (if uploaded within the render instruction).
% ^^^ does this make sense to be mentioned here?
% a named image upload initializes the blob ref count to 1 (for the named reference)
% whereas the blob also has a refcount of 1 when oneshotting,
% because the one reference comes from the image-display action.

Releasing the image by its name will remove the name-to-image association, and thus,
decrement its reference counter.

Uploading a new image with an already used name will first release the old name-to-image association
as mentioned earlier and then register the new image with its name. This will not cause
any visible side effects - existing image fragments to the old image will not be touched.

\subsection{Render Image}

Renders an image that has been previously uploaded.
The image will be rendered with the top-left matching the current ANSI cursor position.
The cursor will not be moved by this operation.

\subsubsection*{Parameters}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
    \hline
    \textbf{parameter name} & \textbf{default} & \textbf{description} \\
    \hline
    \textbf{name} &           & unique identifier referencing a previously uploaded image \\
    \textbf{screen-rows} &    & number of screen cells to render horizontally \\
    \textbf{screen-cols} &    & number of screen cells to render vertically \\
    \textbf{resize-policy} & NoResize & optional, mandates how to resize the image within the screen cells \\
    \textbf{alignment-policy} & MiddleCenter & optional, mandates how to align the image within the screen cells \\
    \textbf{image-x-offset} & 0 & start rendering at the given pixel x-offset cell of the image \\
    \textbf{image-y-offset} & 0 & start rendering at the given pixel y-offset cell of the image \\
    \textbf{image-width}    & screen-rows & optional, number of pixels of the image's width to display \\
    \textbf{image-height}   & screen-cols & number of pixels of the image's height to display \\
    \textbf{status}         & false & request a success/failure status response code from the terminal \\
        & & If value is true, a response is sent back to the application \\
        & & to indicate success or failure. \\
        & & If value is set to false (or parameter is not present), \\
        & & no response is sent back to the application. \\
    \hline
\end{tabular}

% \paragraph*{}
% If parameter \textbf{screen-width} and \textbf{screen-height} are both omitted (or set to 0), then the
% number of screen cells will be automatically determined.

\paragraph*{}
If one of the parameters \textbf{screen-width} and \textbf{screen-height} is present and the other is
missing, the missing one will be automatically determined by preserving the aspect ratio.

\paragraph*{}
Rendered images that produce a padding due to alignment- and resize-policy will fill the gap with the
currently active SGR background color.

\paragraph*{}
Reverse video mode mode (\code{DECSCNM}) will affect the padding color but not the image.

\subsubsection*{Resize Policy}

\begin{tabular}{ |l|l| }
    \hline
    \textbf{Name}          & \textbf{Description} \\
    \hline
    NoResize      & Does not perform any resize, leading to a padding on one or two sides \\
                  & as mandated by the alignment-policy. \\
    ResizeToFit   & Resizes the image to fit the specified screen width and height, \\
                  & leading to a padding on zero or one sides as mandated by the alignment-policy. \\
    ResizeToFill  & Resizes the image to fill the specified screen width and height, \\
                  & preserving the aspect ratio, leading to potential clipping depending on the \\
                  & alignment-policy. \\
    StretchToFill & Resizes the image to fill the specified screen width and height, \\
                  & ignoring the aspect ratio, ignoring alignment-policy. \\
    \hline
\end{tabular}

\subsubsection*{Alignment Policy}

\begin{tabular}{ |l|l| }
    \hline
    \textbf{Name}          & \textbf{Description} \\
    \hline
    TopCenter     & The image is aligned vertically on the top and horizontally in the center of the screen. \\
    TopStart      & The image is aligned vertically on the top and horizontally on the left. \\
    TopEnd        & The image is aligned vertically on the top and horizontally on the right. \\
    \hline
    MiddleCenter  & The image is aligned vertically and horizontally in the center of the screen. \\
    MiddleStart   & The image is aligned vertically centered and horizontally on the left. \\
    MiddleEnd     & The image is aligned vertically centered and horizontally on the right. \\
    \hline
    BottomCenter  & The image is aligned vertically on the bottom and horizontally in the center of
    the screen. \\
    BottomStart   & The image is aligned vertically on the bottom and horizontally on the left. \\
    BottomEnd     & The image is aligned vertically on the bottom and horizontally on the right. \\
    \hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Upload and Render Image}

This uploads and renders the image via a single VT sequence. Therefore no image Id
is required and there won't be any way to reference that image after either.

The parameters of this function is the sum of the image upload and image render parameters excluding the unique
identifier and excluding sub-rectangle rendering parameters.

The image will be rendered with the top-left matching the current ANSI cursor position.
The cursor will not be moved by this operation.

\subsubsection*{Parameters}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
    \hline
    \textbf{parameter name} & \textbf{default} & \textbf{description} \\
    \hline
    \textbf{format} & & a value that determines the image format. See section \ref{sec:supported-image-formtats} \\
    \textbf{data} & & image data in the given input format \\
    \textbf{image-width} & 0 & number of pixels of the image's width to display \\
    \textbf{image-height} & 0 & number of pixels of the image's height to display \\
    \textbf{resize-policy} & NoResize & mandates how to resize the image within the screen cells \\
    \textbf{alignment-policy} & MiddleCenter & mandates how to align the image within the screen cells \\
    \textbf{screen-width} & & number of screen cells to render horizontally \\
    \textbf{screen-height} & & number of screen cells to render vertically \\
    \textbf{auto-scroll} & & boolean, indicating whether or not the page is beign scrolled up \\
            & & if the image would not fit otherwise \\
    \hline
\end{tabular}

\todo{Specify how auto-scroll can be achieved in primary screen for Render and Upload-and-Render actions.}
\todo{Should auto-scroll be only possible in primary screen?}

\subsection{Release Image}

Removes the mapping of the name to the image in a storage pool.
This will cause decrementing the use-count of the previously uploaded image.
Existing rendered images are not affected by this operation.

\subsubsection*{Parameters}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
    \hline
    \textbf{parameter name} & \textbf{default} & \textbf{description} \\
    \hline
    \textbf{name}       & & a unique identifier of the uploaded image \\
    \hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Feature Detection}

\DA is already used to advertise terminal features, including sixel graphics, and thus,
it does make sense to be used to also advertise the availability of \GoodImageProtocol.

There is some improved feature detection specification work ongoing,
so there may be other ways to detect \GoodImageProtocol in the future, when that is ready.

\subsection{Interoperability with other VT sequences}

\subsubsection*{Clearing the screen}

VT sequences (such as \code{CSI Ps J}) that reset at least the textual contents of the screen cells will also
clear their image fragment referencing an underlying image, possibly also releasing the
underlying image(s) from the image storage pool when their reference count goes down to zero.

\subsubsection*{Primary and alternate screen}

Alternate screen and primary screen maintain both their own image storage pool.

When leaving the alternate screen, its image storage pool gets cleared too.

\subsubsection*{Screen cell characters and image tiles}

Image fragments and characters in a screen cell are mutually exclusive.
Therefore, when an image is being rendered into a grid cell, it is replacing the graphics rendition and
character information, except for background color that may be used when filling the padding pixels.

If reverse-video is enabled, foreground color becomes the background color for the padding pixels.

Analogous, when a character is placed into a screen cell that previously contained an image
fragment, this image fragment is being replaced by the character.

\subsubsection*{Image alpha channel and graphics rendition background color}

Images with an alpha channel will blend into the graphics renditions background color of that cell
analogous to how padding pixel color is applied for image fragments.

\subsubsection*{Hyperlinks}

If the terminal emulator supports hyperlinks and the application has initiated a hyperlink, followed
by rendering an image, the whole rendered image becomes hyperlinked, analogous to how hyperlinks
are applied to text.

\subsubsection*{Text reflow}

Text reflow is supported only inconsistently across a few terminals. Therefore this
specification does not attempt to address this for images. When text reflow is going to
be formally specified it must then also address images.

\section{Syntax} % {{{

This section maps each semantic action to actual VT sequences.

\subsection{DCS Message Format}

\todo{message format spec}

TBD. Describe the Message format here that is being implemented in MessageParser.\{h,cpp\}.

\begin{itemize}
    \item inspired by HTTP message protocol
    \item optional sequence of headers and an optional body
    \item header is a name and a value, delimited by equal symbol \code{=}
    \item header sequence is delimited by comma symbol \code{,}
    \item header sequence and body is delimited by semicolon \code{;}
    \item header value and body can be base64 encoded by prepending \\
        an exclamation mark at the beginning of the header's value or body.
    \item superfluous commas in header seperation are ignored
    \item header names without a value reflect a boolean truth value
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Upload Image}

Syntax: \code{DCS u <message> ST}

The payload's format is mandated by the \code{fmt}'s value. However, since it must not contain
any C0 or C1 escape codes, the transport is further protected by encoding it via Base64.

\subsubsection*{Parameters}

\begin{tabular}{ |l|l|l| }
    \hline
    \textbf{header name}   & \textbf{title}   & \textbf{notes} \\
    \hline
    \textbf{f}       & format & enum (see section \ref{sec:supported-image-formtats}) \\
    \textbf{w}       & width & number of image width of the uploaded image (not needed for PNG) \\
    \textbf{h}       & height & number of image height of the uploaded image (not needed for PNG) \\
    \textbf{n}       & name & unique name of the image \\
    \hline
\end{tabular}

The message body contains the image data.

\subsubsection*{Example}

This is a small Bash shell example that is uploading a PNG image with a fixed ID.

\begin{verbatim}
    # Shell function demonstrating how to upload an image:
    function send_image() {
        local ImageId=$(echo -ne "org.binutils.ls.$1" | base64 -)
        local ImageData=$(base64 "$2")
        local ImageFormat=3 # 3=PNG
        echo -ne "\033Puf=${ImageFormat},n=${ImageId};!${ImageData}\033\\"
    }
\end{verbatim}

      &                 & 1 (NoResize), 2 (ResizeToFit), 3 (ResizeToFill), 4 (StretchToFill) \\
    a & alignment-policy & one of: \\
      &                 & 1 (MiddleCenter), 2 (MiddleStart), 3 (MiddleEnd), \\
      &                 & 4 (TopStart), 5 (TopCenter), 6 (TopEnd), \\
      &                 & 7 (BottomStart), 8 (BottomCenter), 9 (BottomEnd) \\
    s & status          & one of: 1 (request status response), 0 otherwise \\
    \hline
\end{tabular}

\subsubsection*{Response Sequence}

When a response status code was requested, the syntax will be as follows:

\begin{tabular}{ |r|l| }
    \hline
    \textbf{VT sequence} & \textbf{description} \\
    \hline
    \code{CSI > 0 i} & Image is rendered successfully \\
    \code{CSI > 1 i} & Image was not rendered. No image with the given Id found. \\
    \hline
\end{tabular}

\subsubsection*{Example}

\begin{verbatim}
    # Shell function demonstrating how to render an image:
    function render_image() {
        # Rendering the given PNG image at the current cursor position with a 20x10 size.
        local ImageId=$(echo -ne "org.binutils.ls.$1" | base64 -)
        local ScreenWidth="20"
        local ScreenHeight="10"
        echo -ne "\033P1:${ScreenWidth};2:${ScreenHeight}rid=${ImageId}\033\\"
    }
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection*{Example}

This is a small Bash shell example that is uploading a PNG image with a fixed ID.

\begin{verbatim}
    # Shell function demonstrating how to render a oneshot image:
    function send_image_once() {
        local ImageData=$(base64 "$1")
        local ImageFormat=3 # 3=PNG
        local GridWidth="20"
        local GridHeight="10"
        echo -ne "\033P1:${ImageFormat};2:${GridWidth};3:${GridHeight}s${ImageData}\033\\"
    }
\end{verbatim}

\section{Editorial Notes} % {{{

\begin{itemize}
    \item Maybe use tables instead of lists for parameter listings?
    \item $0x3A$ \code{:} is not allowed in DCS, check that. Maybe all params should be name-based then ...
    \item Should we mention how to deal with HiDPI displays and content scaling?
    \item How to implement a cat-like too for images without breaking determinism for proxy
        terminals. I.e. how does the proxy terminal know about how many rows will be used when
        a pixel perfect rendering is attempted (resize-policy set to NoResize,
        screen-cols=\$COLUMNS). But what is row count?
